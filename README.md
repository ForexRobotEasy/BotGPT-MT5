# BotGPT MT5

BotGPT MT5 is a MetaTrader 5 (MT5) Expert Advisor (EA) developed by Forex Robot Easy Team. It is designed to execute trades in the forex market based on pre-defined trading signals. This code serves as a sample implementation of the BotGPT MT5 EA.

## Installation and Usage

To use the BotGPT MT5 EA, follow these steps:

1. Include the necessary libraries by adding the following line at the beginning of your code:
   ```mql5
   #include <Trade\Trade.mqh>
   ```

2. Define the global variable `signal` to store the trading signal. This variable will be updated based on market analysis.

3. Implement the `ExecuteTrade()` function to execute trades based on the trading signal. This function opens a new position if there is no open position. It checks the `signal` variable and sends a buy or sell order accordingly. The lot size, stop loss level, and take profit level can be customized.

4. Implement the `AnalyzeMarket()` function to analyze the forex market and set the trading signal. Add your market analysis logic in this function.

5. Implement the `GatherAndAnalyzeData()` function to gather and analyze forex market data. This function sets the trading signal based on the analysis. Customize this function to suit your data gathering and analysis requirements.

6. Implement the `IntegrateNeuroFXEA()` function to integrate Neuro FX EA with BotGPT MT5. This function allows you to combine the two algorithms and enhance your forex trading strategies. Add your code for integration in this function.

7. Implement the `EnableFreeEASelection()` function to enable users to select other EAs for free. This function can provide instructions for selecting the free EA. Customize this function as per your requirements.

8. Implement the `TestCode()` function to thoroughly test the code. This function can be used to verify the efficiency and accuracy of the forex trading strategy implemented in the code.

9. Implement the `OnInit()` function to handle program initialization. Call the necessary functions to perform the required tasks, such as market analysis, data gathering and analysis, trade execution, integration with Neuro FX EA, enabling free EA selection, and code testing.

10. Implement the `OnDeinit()` function to handle program deinitialization. This function can be used to handle program shutdown and clean up any resources if needed.

11. Implement the `OnStart()` function to handle program start. Call the `OnInit()` function to initialize the program and perform the required tasks.
